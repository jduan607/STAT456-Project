# STAT456 Project
Project for STAT456 Applied Multivariate Analysis (Fall 2018) at University of Wisconsin-Madison

## Background
The relationship between the environment and development of a country is always debatable. Environmental pressure grows more and more intense due to the overconsumption and overpopulation. The global hectares greatly measure the amount of biological production for human use and human waste assimilation. [The Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/national-footprint-accounts-2018) related to consumption of ecological footprint per capita in Europe in 2014 is observed and analyzed to detect the features of European countries' developement, location, land types, and assumption.

## Statistical Procedure
+ Principal Component Analysis
+ Canonical Correlation Analysis
+ Multiple linear regression

## Result
The overall finding is that the country that demands more global hectares of all land types, especially land for carbon emission and food consumption, tends to have higher standard of living. Countries in southeastern Europe, most of which are less developed, require small global hectares of all land types. Most countries in northwestern Europe are high developed and consume large global hectares of all land types, especially forest for carbon emission.
